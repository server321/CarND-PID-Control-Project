# Introduction #

The goal of this project is to create a PID controller, tune its hyperparameters by testing on the simulator.

The simulator provides cross-track error (CTE), speed, and steering angle data via local websocket uWS. 
The PID controller must respond with steering and throttle commands to drive the car reliably around the simulator track. I used only steering command to control the car.


# Components of PID #

## Proportional ##

The "P" for proportional means that the car will steer in proportion to the cross-track error, or CTE. CTE measures how far from the middle line of the road the car is. If the car is to the left of the line then you the car should steer to the right and otherwise. The coeficient is proportional to the distance from the lane center. This is the most directly observable effect on the car's behavior. 

 
## Integral ##

The I for "integral" means component that counteracts a bias in the CTE which prevents the P-D controller from reaching the center line. This bias can take several forms, such as a steering drift. If the coefficient is too high for I, the car tends to have quicker oscillations, and does not tend to get up to a quick speed. A low coefficent for I will cause the car to tend to drift to one side of the lane or the other for longer periods of time.

## Differential ##

The D for "differential" means component that counteracts the P component's tendency to overshoot the center line. A properly tuned D parameter will cause the car to approach the center line smoothly. Too high of a coefficient leads to almost constant steering angle changes of large degrees, where although the car will be well-centered it can hardly move. Too low of a D coefficient will lead to the oscillations being too high with more overshooting.

# Tuning hyperparameters #
I experimented with Twiddle to try out different parameters, but removed it from the final code. I found the values and then the final values were determined by manual tuning.

The final hyperparameters are:

Kp = 0.3
Ki = 0.0004
Kd = 4.0

There's an experimental patch for windows in this [PR](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-PID-Control-Project/pull/3)

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./pid`. 

## Editor Settings

We've purposefully kept editor configuration files out of this repo in order to
keep it as simple and environment agnostic as possible. However, we recommend
using the following settings:

* indent using spaces
* set tab width to 2 spaces (keeps the matrices in source code aligned)

## Code Style

Please (do your best to) stick to [Google's C++ style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).

## Project Instructions and Rubric

Note: regardless of the changes you make, your project must be buildable using
cmake and make!

More information is only accessible by people who are already enrolled in Term 2
of CarND. If you are enrolled, see [the project page](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/f1820894-8322-4bb3-81aa-b26b3c6dcbaf/lessons/e8235395-22dd-4b87-88e0-d108c5e5bbf4/concepts/6a4d8d42-6a04-4aa6-b284-1697c0fd6562)
for instructions and the project rubric.

## Hints!

* You don't have to follow this directory structure, but if you do, your work
  will span all of the .cpp files here. Keep an eye out for TODOs.

## Call for IDE Profiles Pull Requests

Help your fellow students!

We decided to create Makefiles with cmake to keep this project as platform
agnostic as possible. Similarly, we omitted IDE profiles in order to we ensure
that students don't feel pressured to use one IDE or another.

However! I'd love to help people get up and running with their IDEs of choice.
If you've created a profile for an IDE that you think other students would
appreciate, we'd love to have you add the requisite profile files and
instructions to ide_profiles/. For example if you wanted to add a VS Code
profile, you'd add:

* /ide_profiles/vscode/.vscode
* /ide_profiles/vscode/README.md

The README should explain what the profile does, how to take advantage of it,
and how to install it.

Frankly, I've never been involved in a project with multiple IDE profiles
before. I believe the best way to handle this would be to keep them out of the
repo root to avoid clutter. My expectation is that most profiles will include
instructions to copy files to a new location to get picked up by the IDE, but
that's just a guess.

One last note here: regardless of the IDE used, every submitted project must
still be compilable with cmake and make./
